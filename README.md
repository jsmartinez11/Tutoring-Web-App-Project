# Tutoring-Web-App-Project

Hi There! My name is Joseph Martinez, and I am a Sophomore in Computer Science. I decided to create this project because I often find myself tutoring students. There are numerous students who struggle with learning; specifically, underprivileged and underrepresented students, ages 5 - 14, struggle in learning English, Spanish, and Math. I have created this tutoring project in order to assess students' comprehension of their materials. During tutoring sessions, I am able to understand their course topics, and create specialized questions to what they are learning in class. If I take questions from online, students are often able to find these answers in fear that they are wrong. By creating this tutoring project, I am able to encourage students to learn and retain the information that their teachers present to them, ultimately allowing me to reduce students' desires to cheat. I hope to utilize this more through online volunteering and in-person tutoring in hopes that I can make a difference for each individual student.
